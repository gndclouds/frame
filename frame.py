print("""buttons.py - Detect which button has been pressed

This example should demonstrate how to:
 1. set up RPi.GPIO to read buttons,
 2. determine which button has been pressed

Press Ctrl+C to exit!

# Buttons connect to ground when pressed, so we should set them up
# with a "PULL UP", which weakly pulls the input signal to 3.3V.

# "handle_button" will be called every time a button is pressed
# It receives one argument: the associated input pin.

# Loop through out buttons and attach the "handle_button" function to each
# We're watching the "FALLING" edge (transition from 3.3V to Ground) and
# picking a generous bouncetime of 250ms to smooth out button presses.
for pin in BUTTONS:
    GPIO.add_event_detect(pin, GPIO.FALLING, handle_button, bouncetime=250)

# Finally, since button handlers don't require a "while True" loop,
# we pause the script to prevent it exiting immediately.
